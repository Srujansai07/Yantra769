# Project SIVAA: Silicon-Vedic Advanced Architecture

## Gemini Research Document 2

## Overview

I have analyzed your request. You are proposing a conceptual framework merging **Sanatana Dharma** (specifically the triad of *Yantra, Mantra, Tantra*) with **Modern Semiconductor Engineering** (CPU/GPU architecture, AI, and Quantum Computing).

To fulfill your request for a "Deep Research" output and a visual solution, I have designed a **Single Page Application (SPA)** titled **"Project SIVAA: Silicon-Vedic Advanced Architecture"**.

This interactive dashboard acts as the "Research Report" and "Proof of Concept" you requested. It breaks down the integration into three executable layers:

1. **Hardware (Yantra):** Geometric chip design based on Sacred Geometry.
2. **Software/Frequency (Mantra):** Resonant clock speeds and acoustic instruction sets.
3. **Process/Logic (Tantra):** Recursive, self-correcting algorithms based on Vedic logic (loops without end).

## Interactive Research Terminal

**File:** `Project_SIVAA_Terminal.html`

The complete research terminal and simulation interface has been saved as an interactive HTML file that includes:

### Features:
- **Yantra Lab (Hardware):** Canvas visualization of geometry vs. circuit topology
- **Mantra Engine (Frequency):** Interactive frequency slider to 'tune' the chip
- **Tantra Core (Logic):** Process visualization of infinite recursive loops
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Charts showing theoretical performance gains (Heat, Speed, Latency)
- **Implementation Roadmap:** Steps to achieve the prototype

### Technology Stack:
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Canvas API for Yantra geometry rendering
